                        <p>Our clients in private equity and venture capital work with us throughout the investment process from early-stage deal sourcing through due diligence, portfolio monitoring and realisation.</p>
<h3>How AlphaSights helps</h3>
<h4>Sourcing</h4>
<p>AlphaSights brings investment professionals at client firms together with senior-level industry executives who can provide an early-stage view on acquisition opportunities, elaborate on industry trends, or help assess key industry drivers. Depending on client needs, <a href="../../solution/telephone-consultations/index.html" title="initial phone-based consultations">initial phone-based consultations</a> may be followed up by <a href="../../solution/meetings/index.html" title="face-to-face meetings">face-to-face meetings</a> or lead to <a href="../../solution/advisory-work/index.html" title="longer-term advisory relationships">longer-term advisory relationships</a> with chosen executives.</p>
<h4>Due Diligence</h4>
<p>AlphaSights supports investment professionals to confirm or refute their investment thesis by helping them to systematically probe into demand and supply dynamics, competitive forces, or technological or regulatory factors impacting target companies.</p>
<h4>Portfolio Monitoring</h4>
<p>As Board Directors, our clients possess a profound understanding of the structural features and major drivers of the industries in which their portfolio companies operate. AlphaSights provides them with ad-hoc or continuous access to the individual or aggregated assessments by industry insiders of the dynamics and evolution of critical business drivers impacting portfolio companies.</p>
<h3>How Clients benefit</h3>
<h4>Gain Superior Industry Insights</h4>
<p>By connecting ad-hoc and as-needed with a thoughtfully chosen array of experienced industry professionals, our clients gain access to expertise and insights otherwise inaccessible or unaffordable.</p>
<h4>Save Time</h4>
<p>Principal investors operating across borders and industries do not have the time to identify, contact, qualify, schedule, negotiate and settle fees with a vast number of potentially relevant industry professionals. Leveraging proprietary search methodologies and our unique relationships, AlphaSights is uniquely placed to accomplish these steps efficiently and minimize time demands placed on busy investment professionals and their support staff.</p>
<h4>Maintain Confidentiality</h4>
<p>We are acutely aware of the sensitive nature of our clients’ business. Our systems and in-built workflows are designed such that client confidentiality is maintained at all times prior to the actual contact with one or more chosen industry professionals taking place. In the case of survey and proprietary data services, client identity is never revealed.</p>
